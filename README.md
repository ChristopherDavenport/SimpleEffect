# SimpleEffect [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ChristopherDavenport/SimpleEffect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ChristopherDavenport/SimpleEffect)

## DO NOT USE: For Example Use Only

Using this will make you very unhappy. It is the dumbest implementation of effects I can accomplish.
Zero bells and whistles, zero performance. If you put this as your effect you will be unhappy.

## Purpose of this project

Provide a meaningful easy way for people to understand Effects and the Typeclass Hierarchy for Cats-Effect
or other Effect Monads. Rather than digging through imperative code written for performance read idiomatic
code that does everything right but is as simple as it can be.
